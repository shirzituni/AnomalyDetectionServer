# AnomalyDetectionServer
 A flight detection server
 
This project contains the following elements:
* Use of design and architecture templates
* Server-client communication and architecture
* Use of data structures and database
* Data streaming (files and communications)
* Implementation of data-based algorithms within the system we will create
* Parallel programming using threads

The client can upload to the server a csv file, update parameters of the algorithm and get back an anomaly report detected.
In addition the customer can enter where the actual anomalies occurred and get an analysis of the accuracy of the algorithm on the data he sent.
